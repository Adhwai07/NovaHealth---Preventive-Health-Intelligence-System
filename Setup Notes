Setup Notes for Reviewers

These instructions outline the steps required to re-run the workflow successfully.

1. Required Inputs
A. Data File Input
The workflow accepts multiple file formats, including:
- CSV
- Excel (.xlsx)
- JSON
- Other tabular formats supported by Opus
Sample files have been provided in this repository if needed.

B. Human Task: Email Address
During execution, the workflow includes a Human Input node that prompts for a valid email address.
This email will receive:
- A regional risk summary
- Tailored intervention plans
- Relevant alerts and forecasts
Please ensure the email entered is valid and accessible for verification.

2. How to Run the Workflow
  2.1 Upload the dataset into the file input node at the start of the workflow.
  2.2 Allow the system to perform a Medical Data Relevancy Check.
      - If the dataset is not medical-related, the workflow will follow the False branch and return an error message as the final output.
  2.3 If the dataset is relevant, the workflow will proceed with:
      - Standardization
      - Cleaning and anonymization
      - Regional categorization
      - Risk calculations
      - Forecasting and intervention generation
  2.4 When the Human Task appears, enter the email address to continue.
  2.5 The workflow will then:
      - Generate the email summary
      - Send the intervention and risk overview to the provided address
      - Produce a detailed regional risk assessment report in the main output

3. Expected Outputs
If the input is medically relevant, the workflow will generate:
- Top regional risks
- A complete regional risk matrix
- Forecasts and intervention plans
- Public health alerts
- Ethical checks and policy compliance
- A comprehensive regional risk assessment report
- An email sent to the specified address
If the input is not medically relevant, the workflow will output:
- A clear error message explaining why the data was rejected

4. Notes & Considerations
- No external credentials, APIs, or environment setup are required.
- All processing uses built-in Opus nodes, so reviewers can run it without modification.
- The only manual interaction required is entering the email address when prompted.
